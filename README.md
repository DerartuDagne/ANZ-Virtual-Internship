Exploratory Data Analysis or EDA is used to take insights from the data.

# About

The Dataset that was given to us is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights we will gather will be genuine.

#[Task 1:Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.example.com)

The main purpose of EDA is to detect any errors, outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the data. 
It allows Analysts to understand the data better before making any assumptions. 

Goal: Excecute data segmentation and visualization.
Update: Visualization of datapoints done with Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and WordCloud

#[Task 2: Predictive Analytics](https://www.example.com)

Goal: Build a regression and decision-tree prediction model.
Update: Built for supervised and unsupervised models
